(Sides et al., 2018).\n","\n","My assumption for this is their political identity are perform through images, that the objects represent in their images might represent their personal qualities or their policy positions.

The bar plots of the objects appearing in the images of Republicans and Democrats show that some objects indicate each party's political owner identity.To begin, the images of Republican members, the conservative party, contain a greater number of ties than the images of Democratic members.The tie object here can represent the suit uniform, which is a male-specific object.\n","\n","Furthermore, we will see that truck and airplane objects are detected in the images of the Republican members. In fact, these objects are related to the military. The object detection model cannot classify military equipment. As a result, the model simply categorizes these objects as truck and airplane.The truck objects here are military vehicles, and the airplanes are military helicopters. The Republican Party believes that the key to maintaining a safe and successful nation is maintaining a strong traditional military; thus, the party values a powerful national defense and a strong military in order to provide increased security and peace (Pew Research Center, 2018).\n","\n","Looking at the objects in the Democratic members' images The objects are different from the Republicans, there are less tie objects appear in their members of congress pictures. The objects appear to have animals (i.e.,  cow and dog) and objects related to food (banana, apple, and orange). According to the party’s platform drafted by the Democratic National Committee (2020), the Democrats believe a powerful government can ensure welfare and equality for all. One of their policy priorities is to support farm workers and promote food security with the aim of developing and growing food systems (Democratic National Committee, 2020). They also aim to protect the humane treatment of farm animals and animal welfare (Democratic National Committee, 2020). Therefore, these objects in the images can emphasize the political identity of the party to seek support.\n","\n","All in all, the objects present in the political figure images from Democrats and Republicans on social media are used with the purpose of communicating with the public, either to create the intention of persuading viewers to side with or against them.
