    "Thailand has a long history of political instability, with strong military culture and monarchical overreach periodically disrupting democracy over the past century. Social media and digital activism have gradually shaped and amplified the nation's political and social discourse over the past decade. Since 2018, Thailand's adoption of Twitter has led to a significant increase in the platform's popularity (Kemp, 2020). Thais on Twitter have, to date, use the platform to discuss controversial and sensitive topics. The #WhatsHappeninginThailand is one of the popular hashtags on Twitter that Thais mainly use English for drawing international attention to know more about the situation in Thailand and publicise protest events (Sombatpoonsiri, 2020).\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, I use the connective action framework as a foundation, which argue that internet users engage in digital activism through self-motivation and individualized activities, without the necessity for traditional organizations to function as intermediaries (Bennett and Segerberg, 2012). To achieve their collective goal, users in the connective action framework can generate their own content under the common hashtag. I proposes that Thai users use Twitter to develop their own narratives via shared hashtags in order to discuss and mobilize support for common aims. From this assumption, I would like to find the major topics that are being discussed in #WhatsHappeninginThailand hashtag."
